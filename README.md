Code repository for our paper entilted "Memory-oriented Decoder for Light Field Salient Object Detection".
+ [Code] You can found in this [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Hz5uizTuDECL4UbkOoBpDg) and the code is t551. Moreover, the checkpoint is [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/10krgmANXUicYPI4QiufYKQ) and the code is tjqy.
+ [poster] [A brief explanation](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uJfrfolJfID8PS7dRPzFJg) for paper
+ [Dataset] Our light field saliency datset(DUTLF-FS) is part of DUTLF. Our DUTLF-FS mainly rely on **focal stacks** in light field.

### Datasets
+ Dataset: DUTLF
1. This dataset consists of DUTLF-MV, DUTLF-FS, DUTLF-Depth.
2. The dataset will be expanded to 3000 about real scenes.
3. We are working on it and will make it publicly available soon. 
+ Dataset: DUTLF-FS
1. DUTLF-FS is part of DUTLF dataset captured by Lytro camera, yet our dataset mainly rely on **focal stack** in light field for accurate salient object detection.   
2. A large scale light field saliency dataset(DUTLF-FS) with 1465 paired images contains focal stack and RGB images. In addition, the dataset download link is [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1hq135pTjbwuda0VMocOsxw) and the fetch code is  vecy. 
3. Three problematic images were deleted for better use in DUTLF-FS, and a detail description can be found in dataset download files. 

### Results

| [DUTLF-FS](https://pan.baidu.com/s/143YuO3nNPP9ZrO2ySRaTsw)  |
| [LFSD](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KcUchn2yx6VHSjch_5-ojw)  |
| [HFUT](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QoAwEn6-wkx10KQGB1S2yA)  |

+ Note: Several samples can't synthesize 12 focal slices on LFSD, and so LFSD only contains 93 samples.
